    Global Game Jam 2015—<em>What Do We Do Now?</em>
  </div>
  <p>Global Game Jam 2015 was an opportunity to play more with polish. We made Salvage, a very cut-down RTS in which the protagonist has to collect parts of a broken ship in order to escape from Earth before the CIA finds her. It was an opportunity to work with animation more than I had done previous, and I think it paid off: this is probably the prettiest of the games I've been involved in making.</p>

  <p>For the theme of "connected worlds", we opted for an asteroids-style game with the mechanic of using a tractor to latch onto, and orbit around, planets rather than having any steering. This worked out pretty well, and I wrote up a post-mortem on the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/08/28/intergalactopol-retrospective/">Ludum Dare site</a>.</p>

  <p>In April 2014, with 6 hours remaining before the cut-off time for Mini-LD
50, I discovered it was running and decided – in a fit of hubris – to make
an entry in that time. The theme was "demakes", and calling on the writing
talents of my old friend Taylor Vaughan we put together a
text-based adventure parody of Call of Duty in the space of 5 hours.</p>

  <p>In January 2014, for the Global Game Jam (this time at City University in
London) the team and I made a hat-filled game for the theme of "we don't
see things as they are, we see them as we are". This was the first time I
had worked with a dedicated musician on the team (the responsibility
generally having fallen to me previously), which was a new and interesting
experience.</p>

  <p>In December 2013, I took part in Ludum Dare 28. The theme was "minimalism"
and we created a minimalist and neon-themed game which took the theme
extremely literally.</p>
  <p>The game came 33<sup>rd</sup>
overall, including 35<sup>th</sup> for Theme, 46<sup>th</sup> for Fun, and
54<sup>th</sup> for Audio, which I put in no small part down to the music
provided by <a href="http://youtube.com/user/moleman183">Moleman</a>.</p>

  <p>In September 2013, we re-formed the core team once again for Ludum Dare 27.
The theme was "10 seconds" and we came up with a physics puzzle game with a
twist: it takes place on the face of a clock, which rotates as time ticks
by.</p>

  <p>In January 2013, I took part in the Global Game Jam, at Creative England in
Bristol. The theme was the sound of a heartbeat. We came up with a horror
game with an interesting mechanic: at the sound of a heartbeat, a pulse
travels across the screen, and you can only see anything within that pulse.
Beyond that, the game was unintentionally a 2D remake of <a href="http://www.parsecproductions.net/slender/">Slender: The
Eight Pages</a>.</p>

  <p>In September 2012, I completed my first game jam for Ludum Dare 24. The
theme was "evolution" which we warped into a lighthearted but fast-pased
game of being chased by mutant mad scientist Charles Darwin. The game came
139<sup>th</sup> overall, and 19<sup>th</sup> in the "Humour" category.</p>
